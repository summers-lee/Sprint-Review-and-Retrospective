# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
Interpreting user needs begins with actively listening to stakeholders and translating their goals into clear, actionable requirements. This involves asking clarifying questions, identifying constraints, and focusing on the problems users are trying to solve rather than specific technical solutions. Once user needs are understood, they can be implemented by breaking them down into functional requirements and prioritizing them based on value and feasibility. Creating user stories helps support this process by framing requirements from the user’s perspective. Regular feedback and iteration help ensure the final program aligns with user expectations.
When developing programs, I approach the process incrementally by breaking large problems into smaller, manageable tasks. In future development work, I hope to incorporate Agile processes such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and sprint reviews. Using iterative development and regular feedback loops will help ensure progress stays aligned with user needs.
Being a good team member in means communicating clearly, collaborating effectively, and being accountable for assigned work. It also involves respecting different perspectives, being open to feedback, and contributing to problem-solving discussions. A strong team member supports others when challenges arise and shares knowledge to improve overall team performance.
